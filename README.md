# ring

## To do

- Move state to views and pass it down as props making the components as dumb as possible.
- Check to see if email already exists on signup

## Requirements

- Markup
- Notifications
- ~~recoil/react-query~~
- ~~Auth0 / react-router to login (JWT?)~~
- ~~NoSQL database - currently Acebase~~
- A way to manage the web-rings
	- Protocol for connections
- RSS feed
- Mailing list
- Basic set-up so that anyone can create their own server, but communicate with others in the ring. Basic decentralisation. But then how does authorisation work? You can't have decentralisation without a central auth server.
