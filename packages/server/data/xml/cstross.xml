      <title>R to @Exceliton: I don&apos;t think the UK publisher ever recorded and released an audiobook edition. In the USA, it was released on CD by Recorded Books. (It came out in 2009, so predates the big boom in online downloadable audiobooks.)</title>

There&apos;s a young couple - young trendy black woman, bearded white guy - who try and get you to do vox pops and pretend to be allies starting a new website. Their questions gradually get dodgy. They&apos;re actually far right.
