      <title>R to @GregMichaelson1: Yes I did, Mr. Annoyed on the Net and Missing the Point. Mind you, I have a 42 years of respect for Le Guin and close to none for you, so getting her name right is a lot more important to me than being grammatical and fully comprehensible to you.</title>

Reduced usually to Triffids, Cuckoos and Kraken - which are all outstanding books of the English apocalypse where much of the horror is humanity’s response to the alien - he is a master of the short story and one of best handlers of casual world-building you can read.</title>

      <title>RT by @cultauthor: Days after it has stopped dancing and demanding drink in almost all of Hookland, the Bone Horse still clip-clops the streets of Mether. Some say it is because it has extra work to do due to number of ghosts in the village. Others that it has an exceptional thirst for roasted ale.</title>
