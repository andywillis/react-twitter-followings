      <title>R to @captainyosarian: Not that I&apos;m aware of (if you have that `catch`Â¹) provided it really is something where you don&apos;t care about the timing of completion.

Â¹ Without the `catch` you&apos;ll get an unhandled promise rejection if the promise rejects, which can be less than ideal.</title>

      <title>So apparently @GoogleWorkspace has decided that they get to tell me to require users to create a browser profile in Chrome?

This process is asinine, unnecessary, and incompetently done -- all the way down to asking the end user to enter one of two numbers on a page (one 16 digits long, the other 12) and not validating the length to help them avoid entering the wrong one.</title>
