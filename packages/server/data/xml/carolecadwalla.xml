      <title>R to @carolecadwalla: On the morning of trial, Banks &amp; I were still trying to reach a settlement.

His demands included an undertaking to retract &amp; never repeat the words from the TED talk: that he lied about his covert relationship with the Russian govt.

And I just couldn&apos;t do it.

      <title>R to @carolecadwalla: There&apos;s more. 

Mrs Justice Steyn found Banks&apos;s claim he received a document entitled &quot;Russian gold sector consolidation play&quot; from a UK associate not a Russian oligarch was &quot;not credible&quot;. 

Also &quot;not credible&quot; was the explanation for why Wigmore said he had been in Moscow.

      <title>R to @carolecadwalla: Mrs Justice Steyn said &quot;Ms Cadwalladr also had reasonable grounds for believing&quot;:

&quot;Mr Banks shared information with Russian officials&quot;

&quot;Mr Banks had been offered sweetheart deals&quot;

He &quot;used terminology suggestive of a r&apos;ship in which he could visit the ambassador with ease&quot;

      <title>R to @carolecadwalla: In her judgment, Mrs Justice Steyn says:

* Arron Banks had &quot;at least four meetings&quot; with Russian officials

* It would be &quot;wrong to expect a journalist from identifying such an inaccurate statement..as a lie&quot;

* The 4 meetings were &quot;probably not the full extent&quot; of it
