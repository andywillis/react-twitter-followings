      <title>R to @jillithd: this is exactly my feeling. I haven&apos;t seen Soul Asylum since college but it was an incredibly lively show that I was happy I&apos;d seen. They did a cover of &quot;play that funky music white boy&quot; that was memorable.</title>

      <title>R to @Bondcliff2008: There are a lot of very agitated liberal do-gooders on local mailing lists trying to encourage even beg other people to take them because they can&apos;t bear responsibility for getting rid of the trash they&apos;ve generated.</title>

      <title>R to @_loveallthis: I know this sounds strange coming from me but I kind of think the blue checkmark situation is a scam. Like, I applied and got verified for the usual reasons but I don&apos;t get the feeling that it&apos;s a robust program in a lot of ways.</title>

      <title>R to @jessamyn: Bishop Levi Jenkins Coppin was unusual in that two of his wives had Wikipedia articles about them but he did not. I&apos;m not well-versed in A.M.E. Church traditions, but a large number of his works survive and can speak for themselves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Coppin</title>

      <title>R to @jessamyn: Book 77: More light fiction set in a library/bookstore! This one is about saving a small library in the UK (which many librarians know is still a thing). Sweet and straightforward, goes nowhere surprising, doesn&apos;t end quite like you think, but a good read in these tough times</title>
