      <title>R to @jessphoenix2018: Look, the arugula had dressing so it&apos;s a salad. Also, in Australia arugula is called &quot;rocket.&quot; I was so confused trying to figure out menus when I first moved there. Rocket certainly sounds like a sexier salad ingredient.</title>

      <title>I worked there from 2005-2007. Can&apos;t say I&apos;m surprised, but I&apos;m definitely sad. I photographed the big immigration protests for the State Archives back then, &amp; I naively hoped it was a sign of good change. ((Sigh))</title>

      <title>Roughly 2/3 of the world&apos;s entire population do not care at all about what the Bible says. It is ludicrous to force any interpretation of biblical worldview on non-believers. When someone says they don&apos;t want to follow your faith, respect them enough to stop proselytizing.</title>
